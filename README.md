Student Chatbot
A simple, rule-based chatbot built with Python, NLTK, and TensorFlow/Keras. This project uses a deep learning model to understand user input and provide relevant responses based on a predefined set of intents. The application features a clean graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

üöÄ Features
Natural Language Understanding: Processes user sentences to classify intent.

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a sequential neural network built with Keras for intent prediction.

Custom Knowledge Base: Easily customizable by modifying the intents.json file.

Graphical User Interface: A user-friendly chat window for interaction.

Extensible: The codebase is modular, making it easy to add new intents and responses.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Backend: Python

Machine Learning: TensorFlow (Keras)

NLP: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

GUI: Tkinter

Data Handling: NumPy, JSON, Pickle

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/talhakamran3-lgtm/Student_chatbot.git](https://github.com/talhakamran3-lgtm/Student_chatbot.git)
cd Student_chatbot

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can install the packages manually: pip install tensorflow nltk numpy)

4. Download NLTK Data
The NLTK library requires some specific data packages to function correctly (like punkt for tokenization and wordnet for lemmatization). Run the following command in a Python shell:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
There are two main parts to this project: training the model and running the chatbot application.

1. Train the Model
Before you can run the chatbot, you must first train the neural network model. The training script will process your intents.json file and create three new files: words.pkl, classes.pkl, and chatbot_model.h5.

Run the training script from your terminal:

python train.py

(Note: Based on your project structure, the training file might be named train.py or similar.)

2. Run the Chatbot GUI
Once the model is trained and the necessary files are generated, you can launch the chatbot application.

python python_gui.py

This will open the Tkinter chat window, and you can start interacting with your bot.

How It Works
The chatbot's logic is based on intent classification.

Training: The train.py script reads the intents.json file, processes the text patterns using tokenization and lemmatization (NLTK), and creates a bag-of-words model. This data is then used to train a sequential neural network that learns to map sentence patterns to specific intents.

Prediction: When a user enters a message in the GUI, the input is cleaned and converted into a bag-of-words array.

Response: The trained model predicts the intent of the user's message. The application then selects a random, appropriate response from the intents.json file corresponding to the predicted intent and displays it in the chat window.
